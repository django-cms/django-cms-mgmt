## Proposing large feature additions

In terms of proposing large feature additions, we follow the best practice of [DEPS](https://github.com/django/deps). To create a proposal, please use this [DEP](https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/template.rst) template and submit it to the [Tech Committee](https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/tech-committee/about.md) [Slack Channel](https://www.django-cms.org/slack) (#technical-committee). The DEP will then be placed on the [agenda](https://hackmd.io/ddhvq_aqS6my9gwhLddyPg) of the weekly TC meeting for approval.
