# About dCA (mission, tasks & processes)

The django CMS Association is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2020 with the goal to drive the success of django CMS, by increasing customer happiness, market share and open-source contributions. We provide infrastructure and guidance for the django CMS project. 

## Mission

- **We innovate and lead**:  We define the long-term roadmap and strategy of its core development. We make sure that bugs and usability problems are fixed quickly. And most importantly: we always ensure the voice of the community is heard. 

- **We foster contribution**: We activate and inspire community members to contribute and maintain the ecosystem in which the CMS can continue to grow and flourish. It is important for us to create an atmosphere in which everyone feels comfortable and welcome.

- **We drive adoption**: We get the word out about django CMS and increase visibility of the CMS in the market. We identify target audiences and drive awareness. We match potential django CMS clients and certified django CMS service providers.

## Funding

As non-profit organization, the dCA is dependent on donations from the django CMS community. The best way to donate is to become a member of the association and pay membership fees. The funding will be funneled back into core development of django CMS and other community projects.
