## Mission

- **We innovate and lead**:  We define the long-term roadmap and strategy of its core development. We make sure that bugs and usability problems are fixed quickly. And most importantly: we always ensure the voice of the community is heard. 

- **We foster contribution**: We activate and inspire community members to contribute and maintain the ecosystem in which the CMS can continue to grow and flourish. It is important for us to create an atmosphere in which everyone feels comfortable and welcome.

- **We drive adoption**: We get the word out about django CMS and increase visibility of the CMS in the market. We identify target audiences and drive awareness. We match potential django CMS clients and certified django CMS service providers.

## Funding

As non-profit organization, the dCA is dependent on donations from the django CMS community. The quickest and simplest way to donate is to become a [django CMS Sponsor through Github](https://github.com/sponsors/django-cms). The funding is used in accordance with our mission statements, currently focussing sponsoring technical development of the django CMS core and [core add-ons](https://www.django-cms.org/en/repositories-plugins/).
