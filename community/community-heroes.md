# A list of our Community Heroes

This is an overview of all the people who volunteer to make the open source django CMS project a success. We like to call them our "Community Heroes". Without their commitment, the django CMS project would not be where it is today. As an open source project, we rely on the help of the community. Our thanks go out to everyone who contributes to the community.
