# Workgroups 

## General Information

Workgroups are the heart of our open-source project. A workgroup is a temporary or permanent group of [Community Heros](/community/community-heroes.md) who work together on a single or several open feature requests, bugs or feature improvements. The creation of a workgroup can be spontaneous and only last for the duration of the assigned task(s) or for long-term cooperation on a specific topic group. 

ℹ️ See all active workgroups [here](https://www.django-cms.org/en/roadmap/)

## Announcing workgroup progress 

For all workgroup members:

# Workgroup FAQ

## Who can join a workgroup?

Anyone can join a workgroup or propose the creation of a new workgroup for an issue that is not on the list yet.

## How do workgroups organize their work collaboration?

The organization of work collaboration in workgroups is up to the group members.

## How can workgroups keep others informed about their work progress? 

In order to sync on the work progress of the workgroups, one member of the workgroup should attend the [weekly tech committee meeting](/tech-committee/weekly-tech-committee-meeting.md) every once in a while to report on the work progress. In case you want to join the weekly tech committee to report on your work progress please get in touch with Nicolai (nicolai@django-cms.org), who will guide you through the process. 

## I have a conflict with members of my workgroup. What do I do?

We trust the group members that the work within the working groups is characterized by mutual respect and a constructive feedback culture (see also our [Code of Conduct](http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/code_of_conduct.html). However, if there is a conflict within a workgroup that cannot be solved by the members, please contact Nicolai (nicolai@django-cms.org) and he will help you.
