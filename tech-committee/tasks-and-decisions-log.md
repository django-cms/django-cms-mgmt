    - Managing: Visibility of child pages of unpublished pages. 
    - Overall result of discussion: Default behavior is to reflect visibility of individual pages only (independently of parent pages). If there should be a use-case for marking pages as "waiting to be published as soon as parents are published", only then create a setting that could enable this behavior.

## 07.10.2022
#### Agenda Points
<small>TBD in in the first 5 min of the meeting</small>

1. Add new entry for next meeting from template
2. Participants: <br />Luis, Marcel, Jens-Erik, Mark, Andrew, Mike, Jacob, Fabian
4. Review agenda and add missing points 
5. Varia: further points raised by Tech Committee members:
    - (Fabian) Introduce a minimal linter for Django templates for all dca repos. Users have identified hiddeous bugs in templates which use `{{Â page.id }}`, e.g. in attributes or javascript. This needs to be `{{ page.id|unlocalized }}` to avoid **breaking a site with page pks of 1000 or more in languages that introduce a thousands separator**. A linter run on pushes will identify these issues. See also https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/pull/7188. 
        - Decision: No general linter
        - Use `{% localize off %}` template tag at the appropriate place in the template.
        - Reminder: Reviewers need to check for this to avoid reintroducing such a bug
    - (Jacob) For all 3rd party packages dependent on django-CMS we have the problem of versioning. Some packages are compatible with version 3, some with version 4 and some with both. So how shall we handle version numbers? Python offers a solution for this, it's named [epoch](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-epochs) numbers. By using them we could distinguish, if a plugin is suitable for version 3 or 4. It also would not mess around with the current version numbers.
        - Avenue 1: Make packages universally support v3 and v4 (e.g., ckeditor)
        - Avenue 2: Make new package to become version compatible (e.g., snippets), potentially with epochs
        - Jacob takes discussion to github discussions.
    - (Jacob) `CMS.settings` overwritten when color scheme is switched. That lets the broswer "forget" which side frame is open, which parts of the page tree are folded out. 
        - There's a fix for this needing review: https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/pull/7407
6. Review Tasks

    - (Luis) Report Luis' initial work and first commits made to the docs.
    - (Marcel) Update on CMS v4. Marcel inquired on status of CMS v4 and especially on implemtation of search functionality. For running projects it will be important which 3.x version will be LTS.

## 09.09.2022

#### Agenda Points
<small>TBD in in the first 5 min of the meeting</small>

1. Add new entry for next meeting from template
2. Guest(s) intro
3. Review agenda and add missing points 
4. Varia: further points raised by Tech Committee members:
    - (Luis) RFC: I would like to share a proposal for updating and improving the documentation. It is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPctyKOoxPkWbfqpc_uRVDV4JN-4xWA73RbOlD97SkM/edit?usp=sharing
        - Luis to continue getting familiar with the 3.11 documentation to get started and implement first quick wins, but at the same time already be involved in the 4.0 workgroup. The goal is to create a new documentation for 4.0 in the long run
    - (Jacob) RFC: I would like to change a page in the documentation:
https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/how_to/namespaced_apphooks.html
      The current docs refer to outdated 3rd party packages and do not make clear what's their purpose.
      For one of my projects I created a much simpler AppHookConfig and could use that to better explain it.
      (This proposal has been accepted during the meeting).

    - Django CMS user Luis Navarro is interested in volunteering as the Documentation Lead
        - Welcome Luis! Nicolai to give Luis a introduction to the documentation workgroup
    - (Andrew / Mark) - Create a new 4.1 release branch to distance the code from the sponsors releases. Gives a clear break from 4.0. We can justify this because the sponsor requires 4.0 for themselves. Using 4.0.x creates conflicts.

    - Andrew / Mark: Where should we host our (coding) style guide? ideally protected and versioned.
        - Andrew has a draft as a starting point
        - Add link in [documenation](https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/code.html)
        - Suggestion by Jacob: to use "we" instead of "you" in the documentation 
    - Andrew: Discussion further to last weeks point, Nephila packages appear to be no longer maintained? Both last changed dec 2020:
        - djangocms-blog
            - Fabian has PR's outstanding
        - djangocms-page-sitemap

        - Nicolai to reach out to Nephila and ask if we can move both repos under the dCA umbrella

      - https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/pull/7249
    - Jacob: AFAIK Paolo changed the plugin-tree to use recursive CTE instead of django-treebeard. However, the code doesn't say so. Problem of treebeard is, that it is susceptible to race-conditions. They are almost impossible to reproduce, but they happen.
        - Maybe get feedback from the community in [discussion board](https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/discussions)?
    - Mario: created a compatibility table

    - (Name) 
3. Review agenda and add missing points 
4. Varia: further points raised by Tech Committee members:
    - Andrew django-cms develop-4 django 3.2 workstream needs to be protected away from django 4+ changes, maybe release/4.0.1 vs 4.0.x? 4.1 would say 4 was released?
        - Next steps: agree on a branch to capture a stable dj3.2 workstream.  
    - Jacob: In model `cms.Page` the fields `created_by` and `changed_by` are strings containing the username. This is a violation of Codd's 2nd normalization rule and should be fixed by using a foreign key pointing on model `auth.User`. 
    - Mark: Treebeard `NodeAlreadySaved` error coming from 4.5.1 (thought this was only a 4.5 issue). This PR is attempting to allow newer treebeard installations; https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-attributes-field/pull/52
    - Mark: Possible new bot to analyse PRs; https://lgtm.com/

        - Decision: Create workgroup "JS Frontend Application" and post proposals there.
    - Jens-Erik: How to deal with PRs where the [fix](https://github.com/MacLake/djangocms-picture/commit/c76cabaafc9d759fb332fec6a0841c90e3179274) is trivial, but a test is demanded that is way more complex? See [issue](https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-picture/issues/108).

    - Mark: Automate cleanup of stale issues/PRs
        - https://github.com/actions/stale
        - How long before an issue/PR is considered stale?
        - Next Step: Mark to have a look at the bot settings and to come up with a proposal for how to configure the bot
    - Mark: New gulp pipeline & dependabot security updates to keep things up-to-date.
    - Mark: Python support for upcoming features.
        - Python 3.6 is [EOL](https://endoflife.date/python), 3.7 has 18mths left
        - Django 4 supports python >=3.8
        - Perhaps django-cms 3 & 4 get a minor release to bring in [python 3.10 support](https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/pull/7126), then [django 4](https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/pull/7184), while other packages in the dCA perhaps stay closer to semver and the django 4 support comes with a major version bump.
    - Jacob Rief: Replace model `menus.models.CacheKey` by wildcard deletion. In Redis this is a feature and for memcached there is a workaround.

        - New permission to set page as HOME must be added.
