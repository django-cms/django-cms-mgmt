# About the dCA Tech Committee

## Mission

The Technical Committee is headed by the dCA Project Management & Technology Officer who must be represented with a board seat. 

The Technical Committee, represented by the Head Tech Committee consults the Executive Board on technical matters. 

It prepares and updates the technical roadmap for approval by the Executive Board and/or the General Assembly, manages incoming feature requests and proposals and takes decisions on awarding credits for work submitted by members.

## Team
The the Technical Committee (TC) will include key developers from companies and others in the django CMS development community - developers who work with django CMS, as well as developers of django CMS - in order to help ensure that all perspectives are represented in important decisions about the software and the project.

The TC may also include representatives of the django CMS community who are not developers but who have a valuable expertise in key fields (user experience, design, content management, etc).

Want to join the TC? Please join the [#technical-committee](https://discord-tech-committee-channel.django-cms.org) and get in touch with the team to get involved. The team will then instruct you on how to participate in the weekly meeting.
