# About the dCA Tech Committee

## Mission

The Technical Committee is headed by the dCA Chief Technical Officer (CTO). 

The Technical Committee, represented by the CTO advises the Association Board on technical matters. 

The tech committee steers the technical development of the django CMS product and is responsible to propose solutions to technical questions and problems in the best interest of the open source spirit of django CMS. 

Specifically, it handles [Requests for Comments (RfCs)](https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/discussions), i.e. feature and change requests and influences the [Technical Roadmap](https://www.django-cms.org/en/roadmap/).

The Tech Committee [meets biweekly](/tech-committee/weekly-tech-committee-meeting.md) and the [meeting protocol](/tech-committee/tasks-and-decisions-log.md) is available publicly.

## Team

The the Technical Committee (TC) includes key developers from companies and others in the django CMS development community - developers who work with django CMS, as well as core developers of django CMS - in order to help ensure that all perspectives are represented in important decisions about the software and the project.

The TC may also include representatives of the django CMS community who are not developers but who have a valuable expertise in key fields (user experience, design, content management, etc).

Want to join the TC? Please join the [#technical-committee](https://discord-tech-committee-channel.django-cms.org) and get in touch with the team to get involved. The team will then instruct you on how to participate in the weekly meeting.
