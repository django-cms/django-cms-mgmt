# Support channels

## Overview

- [Slack](https://www.django-cms.org/slack)
- [Discourse](https://discourse.django-cms.org/)
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/django-cms)

Slack is the right platform for short questions, suggestions or exchanges. 

Questions that might be interesting for others and should be included as FAQs should be posted on Discourse. This is also the right place for feature requests and bug reports. 

For developers who have a specific question, Stackoverflow is the right choice.
