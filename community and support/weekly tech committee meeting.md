# Weekly Event (every Friday, 2pm - 2.45pm): Public tech committee meeting 

The tech committeeâ€™s job is to prepare and update the technical roadmap. It manages incoming feature requests and proposals
and takes decisions on awarding credits for work submitted by members. 

# Join as a guest listener 

Anyone can join the tech committee (TC) meeting and get a first hand look at the work of the tech committee and the status of django CMS development. We encourage everyone who want to contribute to django CMS to attend our weekly meeting and introduce yourself. If you are interested in joining the meeting, please get in touch with Nicolai (nicolai@django-cms.org) and he will happily guide you through the process. 
We are happy to meet you!
