# Workgroups 

## General Information

Workgroups are the heart of our open-source project. A workgroup is a temporary or permanent group of contributors who work together on a single or several open feature requests, bugs or feature improvements. The creation of a workgroup can be spontaneous and only last for the duration of the assigned task(s) or for long-term cooperation on a specific topic group. 

ℹ️ See all active workgroups [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfI8IKz84u-YvE61eePCD-lAbn1haghOiqkvSdO-1yg/edit#gid=0) 

The list shows all current new feature suggestions, improvements, issues and bugs with the corresponding workgroups.

## Reporting of workgroup progress 

For workgroup leaders:
- Visit the weekly [Technical Committee meeting](https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/community%20and%20support/weekly%20tech%20committee%20meeting.md) from time to time and report on the status of the workgroup.

# Workgroup FAQ

## Who can join a workgroup?

Anyone can join a workgroup or propose the creation of a new workgroup for an issue that is not on the list yet. Members of the django CMS Association who are involved in workgroups receive voting rights for their work contributions. 


## How do workgroups organize their work collaboration?

The organization of work collaboration in workgroups is up to the group members. They can decide how they want to collaborate on their assigned tasks. However, the django CMS Association provides various collaboration tools that can be freely used by the group members:

- [Slack](https://www.django-cms.org/slack) 
- [Discourse Forum](https://discourse.django-cms.org/)


## How can workgroups keep others informed about their work progress? 

In order to sync on the work progress of the workgroups, one member of the workgroup should attend the [weekly tech committee meeting](https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/community%20and%20support/weekly%20tech%20committee%20meeting.md) every once in a while to report on the work progress. In case you want to join the weekly tech committee to report on your work progress please get in touch with Nicolai (nicolai@django-cms.org), who will guide you through the process. 


## I have a conflict with members of my workgroup. What do I do?

We trust the group members that the work within the working groups is characterized by mutual respect and a constructive feedback culture (see also our [Code of Conduct](http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/code_of_conduct.html). However, if there is a conflict within a workgroup that cannot be solved by the members, please contact Nicolai (nicolai@django-cms.org) and he will help you.
