# Workgroups 

## What is a workgroup?

A workgroup is a temporary or permanent group of brave volunteers who work together on open feature requests, bugs or feature improvements. The creation of a workgroup can be spontaneous and only last for the duration of the task(s) or for long-term cooperation on a specific topic group. 


## Who can join a workgroup?


Anyone can join a workgroup or create a new work group for a topic that does not yet exist. 

The basis for the workgroups is this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfI8IKz84u-YvE61eePCD-lAbn1haghOiqkvSdO-1yg/edit#gid=0) 

This document lists all current features, issues and bugs with the corresponding workgroups. 



## How do workgroups organize their collaboration?

This is up to the group members. The django CMS Association provides various tools for this. These include:

- Slack 
- Discourse Forum 
- weekly calls 

Workgroups should attend the Technical Committee meeting once a month and report on the status of their tasks.



## How do I join a workgroup?

Very simple. Check out the workgroup list and choose a topic you want to work on by adding your name to the volunteer column. Contact Nicolai (nicolai@django-cms.org), our Community Manager, and he will guide you through the process and get you in touch with the workgroup.
