# Work groups 

## What is a work group?

A work group is a temporary or permanent group of volunteers who would like to work together on open feature requests, bugs or improvements. The creation of a work group can be spontaneous and only last for the duration of the work tasks or for long-term cooperation on a specific topic group. 

Anyone can join a work group or create a new work group for a topic that does not yet exist. 

The basis for the work groups is this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfI8IKz84u-YvE61eePCD-lAbn1haghOiqkvSdO-1yg/edit#gid=0) 

This document lists all current features, issues and bugs with the corresponding working groups. 



## How do work groups organize their collaboration?

This is up to the group members. The django CMS Association provides various tools for this. These include:

- Slack 
- Discourse Forum 
- weekly calls 

Working Groups should attend the Technical Committee meeting once a month and report on the status of their tasks.



## How do I join a work group?

Very simple. Check out the work group list and choose a topic you want to work on by adding your name to the volunteer column. Contact Nicolai (nicolai@django-cms.org), our Community Manager, and he will guide you through the process and get you in touch with the work group.
